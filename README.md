# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢
## Note from the Author ✍️
Hi! I am currently pursuing my B.Tech at **NIT Rourkela** and I am in the middle of my **end-semester examinations** while working on this project. Despite the intense academic schedule, I have put sincere efforts into completing this assignment with clean code, structured documentation, and good practices.  
Thank you for considering my work!

## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a Machine Learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, etc.

## Dataset
- Dataset Source: [Kaggle Titanic Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brendan45774/test-file)

## Features Used
- Passenger Class (Pclass)
- Sex
- Age
- Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard (SibSp)
- Number of Parents/Children Aboard (Parch)
- Fare
- Embarked Port

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Titanic-Survival-Prediction.git
    ```
2. Install required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Open and run the `titanic_survival_prediction.ipynb` notebook.

## Project Structure

## Model Building
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, scaled numerical features.
- **Model Used**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score

## Results
- Achieved a model accuracy of **around 80%**.
- Random Forest outperformed baseline models.
